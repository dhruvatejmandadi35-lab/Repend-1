"${design.spec.visualMetaphor}"

VARIABLES AND WHY EACH ONE MATTERS TO THE CONCEPT:
${vars}

AHA MOMENT TO ENGINEER:
${design.spec.aha_trigger}

Reason through these five questions. Write in plain prose — no JSON, no lists, no headers:

1. FIRST FRAME — what does the canvas show the instant it loads? Describe every element — but for EACH one, state what the learner will learn from watching it. No decorative shapes. If an element doesn't teach something when it moves, remove it.

2. VISUAL MECHANICS — for each variable, describe the exact visual change when it moves AND what that change teaches. The visual change is not just aesthetics — it is the concept made physical. "When rate increases, the stack grows faster than it grew before — this teaches that the growth is not linear, it is self-feeding." Do this for every variable.

3. AHA ENGINEERING — the aha moment is: "${design.spec.aha_trigger}". Describe the 2 seconds before: what the learner expects. Then the 2 seconds after: what actually happens and why it surprises them. The visual must make the difference between expectation and reality unmissable.

4. LIVE FEEDBACK — what text or number updates on screen as the learner interacts, so they can read the concept directly? E.g. not just a bar growing, but "Final balance: $12,847" updating live. Every interaction must produce both a visual change AND a readable output that names what changed.

5. THE TEST — if a learner interacted with this for 60 seconds and learned nothing, what went wrong? Name the failure mode specific to this topic and design against it.

Do NOT use any of these words: slider, button, input, form, checkbox, select, drag, drop, node, widget, component, UI. Describe learning experiences and behaviors only.`;

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
INTERACTIVITY REQUIREMENTS (non-negotiable):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• User must be able to manipulate something within 2 seconds of load.
• Every input produces an immediate, visible response — no lag, no submit step.
• The lab must contain the specific aha moment described in the brief: a point where the user expects one outcome and the result surprises them.
• Result updates live and continuously as the user manipulates (unless the concept is inherently discrete).
• Nothing decorative. Every on-screen element either responds to the user or shows a result.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• ONE complete self-contained HTML file. Inline CSS and JS.
• Vanilla JS only. CDN allowlist: KaTeX (equations), p5.js (particles), three.js (3D). No other libs.
• No localStorage / sessionStorage. No fetch().
• Works in sandbox="allow-scripts".
• Zero console errors on first load.
• Responsive: usable from 360px wide to full desktop.
• Dark theme: bg #0B1220, stage #0E1830, panels #131A2A, border rgba(59,130,246,0.2). Accents: blue #3B82F6, copper #D4A574, success #22C55E, muted #8899BB.
• Canvas 2D or SVG for the main visual — make the visual metaphor literal.
• requestAnimationFrame for all motion. pointerdown/move/up for drag.
• On aha moment: golden pulse on the relevant element.
• On success: green stage glow + real_world_payoff card slides in.
• window.parent.postMessage({ type:"labCheck", result:{ ok:true,  score:1, total:1 } }, "*") on success.
• window.parent.postMessage({ type:"labCheck", result:{ ok:false, score:0, total:1 } }, "*") on wrong.

Before returning, verify ALL of these — fix any that fail before responding:
1. Does every visual element teach something when it changes, or is it just decoration? Remove anything decorative.
2. Is there a live text readout showing the actual value of the concept (not just a shape moving)?
3. Can the learner reach the aha moment described in the brief through normal interaction within 30 seconds?
4. Does each variable change produce a visual result that would surprise someone who hasn't studied this topic?
5. ${imageDataUrl ? "Did you ignore garbled text/fake labels from the image and use real labels from the brief?" : "Does the lab teach the specific insight in the learning goal, not just 'explore this topic'?"}
